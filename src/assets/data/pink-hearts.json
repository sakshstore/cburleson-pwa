        "<p>What could have been so troublesome for her at that age? I don’t even recall her having a boyfriend at the time. She never did drugs before then. It’s not like we lived on skid row or anything – we were at my sweet grandmother’s house for Christ’s sake. Where in the hell does a thirteen year old girl find a bunch of speed?</p>",
