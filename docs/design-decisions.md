# Design Decisions

- I will not use Technology as a key concept as in "Story, Art, Technology" because Technology is a medium. It is just a medium through which I tell stories and deliver art. I wouldn't say "Story, Art, Paper" or "Story, Art, Paint." Besides, I only want to be using technology (computers and software) in a highly creative context. I do not want to make the mistake of finding myself manging some software product, which is providing no more creative outlet - or some business that takes more focus on the business than on what it creates.
- For the sake of longevity, I will strive always to achieve what I can without the use of a framework (i.e. exercvising a preference for web platform standards only)
