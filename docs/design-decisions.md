# Design Decisions

- For the sake of longevity, I will strive always to achieve what I can without the use of a framework (i.e. exercising a preference for web platform standards only)
- I will not refer to other social media channels (e.g. "Follow Me" on the About page). My goal is to centralize my information on my site and bring readers from those channels to my site and not the other way around.
- Rule 1 - Organize your Files Around Features, Not Roles
