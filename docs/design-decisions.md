# Design Decisions

- For the sake of longevity, I will strive always to achieve what I can without the use of a framework (i.e. exercising a preference for web platform standards only)
- Avoid hierarchy in the URL where possible. It imposes one hierarchical organization model when, in fact, there can be many. Let the slug of a document be its unique identifier, try to have it at the root, and leverage proper server redirects when the slug needs to change.
- I will not refer to other social media channels (e.g. "Follow Me" on the About page). My goal is to centralize my information on my site and bring readers from those channels to my site and not the other way around.
