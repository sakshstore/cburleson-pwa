# Quality assurance checklists

## Before ANY source code commit...

- Document source code has been formatted.
- Ensure that any version numbers anywhere or Last Modified dates on page components has been updated.
- Make sure that any temporary DEV only switches are switched back to PROD.
- Check that document.title is set (browser window or tab reflects accurate title).


## Before PROD deployment

- Appearance has been checked under simulated conditions of color blindness.
