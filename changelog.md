## [1.5.0] - 2020-01-11

- **Added** pages from legacy WordPress blog:
    - [/user-impersonation-in-websphere-portal-video-demo](https://codyburleson.com/user-impersonation-in-websphere-portal-video-demo)
    - [/wcm-libraries-video-overview](https://codyburleson.com/wcm-libraries-video-overview)

    - [/touch-all-items-in-a-wcm-library](https://codyburleson.com/touch-all-items-in-a-wcm-library)
- **Modified**
    - `package.json` - updated prismjs version; since sparql and turtle components are now part of the package, I was also able to remove the `src/assets/prismjs` directory and have all files that referred to those refer to the components that are now in the package.
    - Gave `title` attribute to all iframes to improve Lighthouse Audit accessibility score (which was 78 before this change).
    - Gave new `showInMenus` attribute to items in `site-data.json`. Items not appearing in menus will still have a route in the router; this attribute can now be read to skip rendering in certain or all menus, however. It is used, for example, in the [/memories-of-momma-1] series. Only the first post in the series shows up in the blog menu of posts. The rest of the items ARE in the site-data.json file, so they have routes (and this allows a NEXT/BACK navigation through the series).
    - Removed `EnvironmentConfigService` in favor of more simplified use of `src/helpers/utils.ts`.
    - Gave Prev and Next controls to `IA Files` content series and removed parts 2 through 5 from menus; this now mimics how the Memories of Momma series works.
    - Gave Prev and Next controls to `Create a player health status indicator for the Unity GUI` content series and removed parts 2 through 5 from menus; this now mimics how the Memories of Momma series works.
